SUMMARY:Combining Solr and Elasticsearch to Improve Autosuggestion for Local Search on Mobile - Toan Luu\, local.ch AG
DESCRIPTION:Many search applications simply suggest queries or data items with a prefix match on what the user is typing sorted by popularity. With the advent of the mobile era\, local.ch becomes one of the most used applications for local search in Switzerland. Some characteristics of a mobile application e.g. (a) difficulty of typing on small screen\, and (b) more available personalized data from users (e.g. location)\, generated challenges for us when implementing the autosuggest feature. We finally brought a better autosuggest experience to our users based on: their search history\, popularity of internal and external data\, user context awareness (language\, location)\, spellchecker... In this talk we will describe the architecture of our autosuggest feature\, how did we use Solr as a search component and Elasticsearch as a data aggregation component to improve autosuggest in our mobile application.

SUMMARY:Dynamics of Benchmarking Distributed Key-Value(KV) Store (Hbase\, Cassandra\, Accumulo\, Hypertable\, Aerospike) for Hosting TeraBytes of Data - Pracheer Agarwal\, Inmobi & Kunal Gautam\, Inmobi
DESCRIPTION:Identifying a KV store to host terabytes of data\, from wide range of choices\, for a set of given use cases\, is a daunting proposition. Even after crossing the fearsome first step and narrowing down the candidates\, it is non-trivial to explain and reason the actual results of benchmarking experiments with the expected results. There are multiple variables at play and it is not often clear on how these interplay at run time. In this talk\, we present our experiences and methodology of how to analyze and effectively benchmark a distributed KV store. This involves monitoring and characterizing key server parameters like RAM\, CPU\, network\, storage\, page cache\, IO scheduler\, JVM size\, GC tuning and logically reason out their effects on the overall performance and capabilities of the underlying KV store. These parameters were monitored by utilities like iostat\, dstat\, iftop\, jstat and cachestat

SUMMARY:Protecting Enterprise Data In Apache Hadoop - Owen O'Malley\, Hortonworks
DESCRIPTION:Hadoop has long had strong authentication via integration with Kerberos\, authorization via User/Group/Other HDFS permissions\, and auditing via the audit log. Recent developments in Hadoop have added HDFS file access control lists\, pluggable encryption key provider APIs\, HDFS snapshots\, and HDFS encryption zones. These features combine to give important new data protection features that every company should be using to protect their data. This talk will cover what the new features are and when and how to use them in enterprise production environments. Upcoming features including columnar encryption in the ORC columnar format will also be covered. By encrypting particular columns\, enterprises can control which users have access to particularly sensitive columns that contain personally identifiable information or financial information.

SUMMARY:Overcoming the Many-to-Many Data Mapping Mess With Apache Streams - Steve Blackmon\, People Pattern
DESCRIPTION:These days we have the tools and resources to collect and wrangle data at unprecedented scale\, yet we remain plagued by compatibility gaps and semantic nuances with every new source we invite into our domain. Despite the best efforts of well meaning folks for decades\, data integration remains a many-to-many problem. Apache Streams (incubating) is an open-source real-time reference implementation for the Activity Streams specification. Streams contains libraries and patterns for specifying\, publishing\, and inter-linking schemas\, and assists with conversion of activities and objects between the representation\, format\, and encoding preferred by supported data providers\, processors\, and indexes. In this talk I will explain what Streams does\, how it works (more or less)\, and how it can be used to compile a real-time\, multi-network\, polyglot content repository of profiles\, posts\, etc.

SUMMARY:IPython Notebook as a Unified Data Science Interface for Hadoop - Casey Stella\, Hortonworks
DESCRIPTION:Data Science on Hadoop can be a daunting journey as you generally are spanning multiple tools and different interfaces. Furthermore\, while there are people out there doing data science\, worked examples are few and far between. As part of the Social Security Act\, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has begun to publish data detailing the relationship between physicians and medical institutions. This data has been analyzed cursorily in the press\, but an in-depth outlier and benford's law analysis hasn't been attempted (to my knowledge). I will present an example of using Apache Spark and Hive on Hadoop to do the above analysis without leaving IPython notebook. This should motivate iPython and the Python bindings of Spark as a fantastic environment to do data science.

SUMMARY:Apache Tika for Enabling Metadata Interoperability - Michael Starch\, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Nick Burch
DESCRIPTION:Apache Tika is the de facto standard technology for textual content and metadata extraction from over a thousand different file types. Given the growing importance of metadata\, Tika has become a fundamental tool\, providing support for many metadata models. However\, enabling uniform access to very large sets of heterogeneous documents requires dealing with most accurate interoperability techniques\, such as metadata mapping. In this talk\, Michael and Nick will review existing solutions based on Tika that make possible to obtain consistent metadata across file formats (i.e.\, TikaCoreProperties\, Solr&rsquo;s ExtractingRequestHandler) and then present a new component for Tika. This integration provides an extension of Metadata object in order to achieve metadata interoperability by using a highly configurable\, fine-grained mapping technique that subsumes schema mapping and instance transformation.This work has been proposed by Giuseppe Totaro (&ldquo;Sapienza" University of Rome) and Chris Mattmann (NASA JPL).

SUMMARY:A Tale of Two Graphs: Property Graphs and RDF - Andy Seaborne and Paolo Castagna\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Property Graphs and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) are both graph data models. Property Graphs originated with data practitioners while RDF was developed at W3C as an information model for the web. Both graph data models are "schema-neutral"\, there is no rigid organization of data up-front. Applications decide which part of the data graph to use and how to view it. New data and new applications can be introduced at any time without disturbing existing usage. In this talk we will introduce both data models and look at some uses to show where they are (and are not) used. We will look at contrasting features of the data models by looking at use cases. We will then look at two systems\, Apache Spark/GraphX\, for property graphs\, and Apache Jena\, for RDF databases\, and how they deal with graph structure and how they can scale to big data.

SUMMARY:Unified Access to All Your Data Points With Apache MetaModel - Kasper Sørense\, Human Inference
DESCRIPTION:The wave of Big Data has overwhelming potential\, but has also revealed an overwhelming challenge in the need to combine multiple sources. The representation of data is growing immensely just like the amount of data is &ndash; you might very well be ingesting as many sources as this: Relational\, NoSQL\, Hadoop\, XML/JSON/CSV files\, Cloud/SaaS systems and search indexes. In this presentation\, Kasper S&oslash;rensen will introduce Apache MetaModel. With this project metadata has been put first and querying is based on this concept too. Apache MetaModel allows for a uniformed view of data from many sources\, but just as important it also enables Data Federation and Data Integration patterns that are automatically adapting based on the metadata available in the source. The talk will be practically oriented\, showing running code with MetaModel and examples of production usage in multiple business cases.

SUMMARY:Testing Big Data Pipelines Made Super Easy - Pallavi Rao\, Inmobi & Pavan Kumar Kolamuri\, Inmobi
DESCRIPTION:Your company has developed a system that crunches humongous data from multiple data sources. It involves multiple and varied processing modules. Each of the individual modules has been well tested. But\, when you try to deploy these modules and connect them either in an integration or a staging environment\, you face issues. To debug these errors and re-test them requires you to set up a mirror environment and is time consuming. So\, you write complex integration tests and equally complex setup scripts. Apache Falcon and Falcon Unit to your rescue! While Apache Falcon alleviates some of the problems of pipeline orchestration\, Falcon Unit\, a feature of Falcon\, helps users test their entire pipeline and data lifecycle without even setting up a test environment. This talk will outline the capabilities of Falcon Unit and how it helps users test data pipelines early on in the development phase.

SUMMARY:Recent Evolution of Standards for Geospatial Applications and TheirIimplementation in Apache SIS - Martin Desruisseaux\, Geomatys
DESCRIPTION:Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing geospatial applications which conform to international standards. SIS implements interfaces derived from UML published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In the North America ApacheCon 2014 we introduced the OGC vision and how SIS implements the &ldquo;geospatial metadata&rdquo; and &ldquo;referencing by coordinates&rdquo; international standards. In this presentation we will present what is new on the standards front: the &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; revision published in 2014\, and the &ldquo;Well-Known Text 2&rdquo; format which can be seen as an evolution of &ldquo;referencing by coordinates&rdquo;. We will present which problems the new standards solve\, and how SIS preserves compatibility between the old and new standards. Finally we will present the plan for next SIS developments.

SUMMARY:S2Graph : A Large-Scale Graph Database with HBase - Doyung Yoon\, Daumkakao
DESCRIPTION:As dominant social network service provider\, Daumkakao confronted several technical challenges to store and traverse large graph data. First\, our social network has 10 billion edges and 200 million vertices and users create 1 billion new edges everyday by interacting with our services so our system needed to be distributed and scalable. Second\, our system needed to provide low-latency and high concurrency to meet our quality of service. Third\, for viral effect\, user`s activities should be delivered to right place at right time in real time so simple result cache can`t be used. Lastly\, there are about a hundred of services that daumkakao is operating and our system needed to provide common way to store and traverse data for synergy between services. S2Graph successfully solved these technical challenges\, so we'd like to introduce the methodology and architecture we used.

SUMMARY:Encryption and Anonymization in Hadoop - Current and Future - Balaji Ganesan\, Hortonworks and Don Bosco Durai
DESCRIPTION:As enterprises expand usage of Hadoop as a platform to store and process data\, data security and compliance needs in the platform are becoming more pertinent. Beyond the traditional Hadoop security controls of authentication through Kerberos\, or access management through Apache Ranger\, users are increasingly asking for encrypting data when it is being transmitted or when data is stored in disk. In relation to this\, there is a movement towards anonymizing the data by tokenizing or masking it\, with the intent of using the data in the query processing while protecting the sensitivity by hiding the original value from the end user. The community has recently built encryption in HDFS file system. In this talk we look at the current encryption capabilities in Hadoop and areas where the community need to focus to further enhance Hadoop as an enterprise ready data platform.

SUMMARY:Integrating Apache Spark with an Enterprise Data Warehouse - Michael Wurst\, IBM
DESCRIPTION:This session will discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating Apache Spark with enterprise data warehouses\, especially the impact of columnar storage on the example of IBM DB2 and IBM dashDB. We will show how columnar storage can help to increase scalability and reduce response time\, especially when pushing down processing of projections and aggregates to the database instead of processing them in Spark natively. Key takeaways from the session are: 1.How to benefit from the features of closed-source data warehouses from Spark without access to internal data structures\, 2.the role of storage when working with large warehouses from Spark\, 3. Opportunities of columnar storage vs. row based storage\, 4. How such an integration impacts end-to-end analytics based on Spark MLlib.

SUMMARY:Synthetic Data Generation for Realistic Analytics Examples and Testing - RJ Nowling\, Red Hat
DESCRIPTION:Big Data users are faced with an enormous gap between trivial tutorial applications and real-world analytics pipelines. Word count and TeraSort have limited value as blueprints and may not exercise enough of the data processing stack to be useful for testing deployments. Since real data are typically encumbered by privacy or intellectual property concerns\, tutorials and test cases often use small or unrepresentative data sets. Generative models can enable a new class of realistic example and test applications by synthesizing rich and complex data sets. Furthermore\, synthetic data can be scaled from a single laptop to data centers. We will present on data generators\, such as BigPetStore from Apache BigTop\, influenced by data we&rsquo;ve analyzed in the Emerging Technologies team at Red Hat. We also discuss realistic example applications and usage for smoke-testing deployments.

The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that provides exactly-once semantics\, low-latency processing\, and system-managed operator state. Flink's high-level programming APIs and support for batch processing\, make Flink a good choice for real-time data analysis. Apache Flink is one of the most active big data project in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. This talk presents Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features. It discusses the pipelined execution engine for low latency processing\, the operator state management and fault tolerance mechanisms. It will cover master high availability and system monitoring and also show a performance evaluation of the system.

SUMMARY:High-Throughput Processing With Streaming-OODT - Michael Starch\, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
DESCRIPTION:Upcoming customers of Streaming-OODT have predicted that their system will operate at data throughputs of 10Gb/s. Thus in order to use Streaming-OODT at these throughputs\, the system must be characterized and well understood in order to support customers&rsquo; needs. This presentation discusses Streaming-OODT&rsquo;s performance processing non-trivial data at these scales and the lessons learned from operation in this environment. Streaming-OODT uses various other Apache technologies to support its mission to provide a high-performance data system. These technologies include: Apache Kafka\, Apache Spark\, Spark Streaming\, and Apache Mesos. This presentation will therefore discuss the performance of these technologies working together at high-throughputs and will discuss lessons learned orchestrating these technologies for high-performance as part of the Streaming OODT system.

SUMMARY:Data Ethics - Louis Suárez-Potts\, Age of Peers\, Inc.
DESCRIPTION:I examine the ethics of Big Data in several ongoing projects and the possibilities of engaging subject communities in the processes and projects. As background: The ethics of data\, especially "Big Data\," can be considered as the linked ethics of gathering the data and then interpreting it. Big Data--the data and interpretation dyad--complicates this otherwise dull as dishwater process in part by obscuring acquisition and reading it as discovery\, and in part by abstracting the particular elements making up the data even as those may refer to persons and their doings. That is: Were an experiment conducted on any population\, the persons objectified would likely have to sign their consent. This talk looks to ways to engage (and so form) communities as subjects and not just objects of Big Data projects. Apache's important projects are key here.

SUMMARY:Adding Insert\, Update\, and Delete to Apache Hive - Owen O'Malley\, Hortonworks
DESCRIPTION:Apache Hive provides a convenient SQL query engine and table abstraction for data stored in Hadoop. Hive uses Hadoop to provide highly scalable bandwidth to the data\, but until recently did not support updates\, deletes\, or transaction isolation. This has prevented many desirable use cases such as updating of dimension tables or doing data cleanup. We have implemented the standard SQL commands insert\, update\, and delete allowing users to insert new records as they become available\, update changing dimension tables\, repair incorrect data\, and remove individual records. This also allows very low latency ingestion of streaming data from tools like Storm and Flume. Additionally\, we have added ACID-compliant snapshot isolation between queries so that queries will see a consistent view of the committed transactions when they are launched.

SUMMARY:Deriving Business Value From Large Image Collections on Hadoop - Michael Natusch\, Pivotal
DESCRIPTION:Image collections are rapidly growing in size. Efficient image management is necessary for large image collections to ensure easy searching and browsing. In this talk\, we will describe how large image collections can be efficiently managed by presenting a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system built on Hadoop. A CBIR system takes as an input a query image and returns images depicting content most similar to the input query image. Putting together a CBIR system involves building many components: the image collection\, a feature extractor\, and machine learning models for mining similar images. In this talk\, we will present how a CBIR system can be easily and efficiently realized using Hadoop and SQL on Hadoop technologies. The system we present here discovers latent visual topics associated with each image and retrieves images based on similarity between corresponding visual topics.

DESCRIPTION:Apache CouchDB 2.0 will bring Dynamo-style clustering to CouchDB\, allowing data and applications to scale out over hundreds of nodes for increased throughput and storage. While operation of a single-node CouchDB instance will remain largely unaffected\, the addition of clustering and sharding introduces some new annoyances which have the potential to complicate operational life. In this talk\, Mike will identify the parts of clustered CouchDB 2.0 that could be considered to be particularly awkward from an operations perspective so that we can be better prepared when things start to get real.

SUMMARY:Apache Sentry (incubating) : Fine-Grained Access Control to Hadoop Ecosystem - Sravya Tirukkovalur\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Historically\, each Hadoop component offers its own method of access control so each one needs its own set of permissions rules - even when they are accessing the same data in Hadoop. This is an administrative nightmare that slows the adoption of Hadoop when sensitive data is involved. Apache Sentry is a framework that enables fine grained\, role based authorization for multiple Hadoop ecosystem components. Apache Sentry is a highly modular system that support authorization for various data models like Database style schemas\, search indexes etc. It comes with out of the box support for SQL query frameworks like Apache Hive and Cloudera Impala Apache Hive\, extending the table privileges to underlying HDFS storage\, as well as open source search framework Apache Solr. This session will present an overview of Apache Sentry.

DESCRIPTION:Apache CouchDB is a document-centric database. It also replicates. It can make exact copies of a database and keep them in sync--even as the network comes and goes. Both (or more) databases can be actively written too and changes synchronized across them. There is no center. Add PouchDB\, a CouchDB compatible database that lives inside the browser or node.js\, and you have an architecture ready to survive the fickleness of technology\, businesses\, and other regimes. The end result is data where you need it. We'll take a look at architecting for a decentralized future built of documents delivered democratically across all the divides.

SUMMARY:Hive on Spark: What It Means to You? - Xuefu Zhang\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Apache Hive has wide use cases for batch-oriented SQL workloads for ETL and data analytics in the Hadoop ecosystem. Up to now\, most of the workloads are still executed by a 10 year old technology\, MapReduce. On the other hand\, Apache Spark as a general\, open-source data processing framework is positioned to replace MapReduce with faster data processing and efficient memory utilization. The Hive on Spark initiative introduced Spark as Hive's new execution engine\, providing faster SQL on Hadoop while maintaining Hive's feature richness. With a joint effort from the Hive community and feedback from early adopters and beta users\, Hive on Spark is ready for production deployment! This presentation will share with you the motivation\, architecture\, deployment practice\, and performance tuning. A live demo will be given to conclude the presentation.

DESCRIPTION:The Big Data Platform team at Netflix maintains a cloud-based data warehouse with over 10 petabytes of data stored predominantly in Parquet format. Our platform has traditionally leveraged Pig for ETL processing\, Hive for large analytic workloads\, and Presto for interactive and exploratory use cases. For a long time\, Spark seemed attractive to complement our platform\, but technical gaps prevented effective use at scale in our environment. Recent improvements have allowed us to add Spark to our cloud data architecture and interoperate seamlessly with the other tools and services in our stack. We will go into detail about our deployment configuration and what it takes to run Spark alongside traditional workloads on YARN. We will share examples of a few of our largest workflows translated to Spark for comparison in terms of both performance and complexity.

SUMMARY:Collecting User's Data in a Socially-Responsible Manner - Konark Modi\, Cliqz
DESCRIPTION:Data from users is needed to build great products. Google\, Facebook\, Doubleclick would not be able to offer their services unless they had tons of data. Cliqz is no exception\, it needs massive amounts of query-logs\, browsing patterns\, etc. to build its search engine and phishing protection. Such data is also collected by other search engines like Google\, Yandex and Bing. Industry standard is to send raw data and sanitize and filter out at the 'backend'\, however\, this approach implies absolute trust on the company's good intentions\, more so there is always a risk of a data-breach or a government subpoena. Cliqz developed a framework called 'Human Web' that combines algorithms and an open infrastructure to collect data in an anonymous way by removing any trace of user identifiability. The 'Human Web' will be open-sourced to encourage others to collect user's data in a safer manner.

DESCRIPTION:You have a data processing service you want/need to deploy\, you have picked your Apache Foundation components you want to leverage\, and begin to start developing and deploy your apps. As you iterate you start you quickly learn that ASF projects and best practices move pretty fast and you have to deal with the various issues with changes in versions/configurations not only in the ASF components you depend on\, but also in your application itself. This tutorial session will walk users through Apache Bigtop tooling and reference examples provided by the community to put together a framework and processes that empower users to better handle change management and improve confidence when deploying their data applications/services. General knowledge of software testing and tools such as Jenkins is helpful\, but not required.

SUMMARY:Upholstering Apache CouchDB - Benjamin Young\, The Hypothesis Project
DESCRIPTION:Apache CouchDB does two things other databases don't: it replicates and it speaks HTTP as it's primary protocol. These unique qualities all you to build applications that are "of the Web" but that can also move "off the Web"--into your local network\, your farm equipment\, or the phone you're carrying. In this tutorial we'll take a look at CouchApps. CouchApps are application logic (index definitions\, document and result templates\, validation functions) that live inside a CouchDB database along with the static HTML\, JS\, CSS\, and images needed for the UI. In this tutorial we'll take a look at various tools for building\, integrating\, and deploying CouchApps. We'll take a deep dive into building a CouchApp: both the thought process and the code. Near the end\, we'll throw a replication party--moving the app between attendee devices sharing the app and it's accumulated data.

SUMMARY:Configuring and Optimizing Spark Applications with Ease - Nishkam Ravi\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Spark API exports intuitive and performant one-liners for data processing\, which hide complexity and allow applications to be developed quickly. As an in-memory system\, Spark has to be configured properly for performance and stability. This can sometimes be challenging. Based on internal deployments and interaction with customers\, we conclude that (i) most Spark woes can be traced back to misconfiguration\, and (ii) there is a need for tools that can aid configuration\, performance optimization and debugging. In this talk\, we will discuss common Spark configuration pitfalls and show how they can be avoided with the help of the auto-configuration and optimization tool being developed at Cloudera.

SUMMARY:Hadoop and Kerberos: the Madness Beyond the Gate - Steve Loughran\, Hortonworks
DESCRIPTION:When HP Lovecraft wrote of forbidden knowledge about non-human deities\, knowledge which would reduce the reader to insanity\, most people assumed that he was making up a fantasy world. In fact he was documenting Kerberos and its Hadoop integration. There are some things humanity was not meant to know. Most people are better off living lives of naive innocence\, never having to see an error message about SASL or GSS\, to never stare in terror at classes only whose initials\, UGI\, are ever spoken aloud -or more accurately\, whispered. This talk goes into the depths\, to the knowledge which you need to write applications in a secure Hadoop cluster\, knowledge that may drive you insane. Forever more\, you shall fear voices calling out in the night\, voices saying things like "we have an urgent Kerberos-related support call -can you help?"

SUMMARY:Data Quality on Mars - ISO 80000 and other Standards -Werner Keil
DESCRIPTION:Big Data without Data Quality becomes messy and meaningless in most cases. Therefore\, data and measurements have to be stored and transferred in a standard way. We all know that when representing a temperature\, for example\, we normally have it as decimal/float. But\, is this float in Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? One of the most vivid examples was Mars Climate Orbiter being lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion\, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-seconds (lbf&times;s) instead of the metric units of newton-seconds (N&times;s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed. In this session we're going to explore data quality and measurement standards like ISO 80000 or UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure)\, Unit support for programming languages and APIs plus projects using them like Apache SIS\, Performance Co-Pilot or uDig.

SUMMARY:Implementing a Highly Scalable In-Memory Stock Prediction System with Apache Geode (incubating)\, R and Spring XD - William Markito Oliveira\, Pivotal and Fred Melo\, Pivotal
DESCRIPTION:Finance market prediction has always been one of the hottest topics in Data Science and Machine Learning. However\, the prediction algorithm is just a small piece of the puzzle. Building a data stream pipeline that is constantly combining the latest price info with high volume historical data is extremely challenging using traditional platforms\, requiring a lot code and thinking about how to scale or move into the cloud. This session is going to walk-through the architecture and implementation details of an application built on top of open-source tools that demonstrate how to easily build a stock prediction solution with almost no source code - except a few lines of R and the UI interface based on JavaFX\, using Apache Geode for fast data and real-time notifications\, combining streaming and distributed processing for stock indicator algorithms.

SUMMARY:Using Natural Language Processing on Non-Textual Data with MLLib - Casey Stella\, Hortonworks
DESCRIPTION:Natural language processing techniques are well established due to their obvious utility. Further\, the rise in unstructured textual data has resulted in mature\, distributed and scalable implementations beginning to be seen. While textual data is extremely common\, there is apparently unstructured data which has underlying structure in the same way words which compose sentences have an underlying grammatical structure. This talk explores borrowing some natural language programming techniques to analyze the structure in non-textual data. In particular\, we consider the Word2Vec implementation in MLLib to help us organize and analyze non-textual clinical event data (I.e. Diagnoses\, drugs prescribed\, etc.). We will explore connections between diseases and drugs in an unsupervised way with Python\, Spark and MLLib.

SUMMARY:Faster ETL Workflows Using Apache Pig & Spark - Praveen Rachabattuni\, Sigmoid Analytics
DESCRIPTION:Pig on Spark aims to combine the simplicity of Pig with faster execution engine Spark and make Pig more promising to developers. Currently\, with the help of Apache foundation\, various contributions are working on the project for a release quality build. With Pig on spark\, significant performance benefit has been observed in ETL workflows already running on MapReduce. Our initial benchmarks have shown 2x-5x improvement over Mapreduce. For a benchmarking test\, we considered the &lsquo;distinct&rsquo; operation. We used the wikistats dump for 25 days with a size of 270G\, on a cluster involving one master and four worker machines (16 cores and 64GB RAM each). It took about 14 mins with Pig on Spark\, compared to about 30 mins on Mapreduce. In this talk\, Praveen would be sharing the progress of the project with the community and help people take advantage of Pig-Spark in their workflows.

SUMMARY:Integrating Fully-Managed Data Streaming Services with Apache Samza - Renato Marroquinm ETH Zurich
DESCRIPTION:Recently\, the interest in highly scalable stream processing engines has risen\, thus many projects have appeared. Apache Samza is a distributed stream-processing framework that uses Apache Kafka for messaging\, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance\, and resource management. It is one of the most popular stream processing engines out there used by many high-profile companies. On the other hand\, we have Amazon Kinesis that is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data which allows users to scale the amount of data ingested by Kinesis without worrying about the infrastructure details. This presentation gives a brief introduction about the very popular Samza-Kafka integration\, then focuses on the new Samza-Kinesis integration\, and explains users the new opportunities they have due to the new Samza-Kinesis integration.

SUMMARY:Apache Spark for High-Throughput Systems - Michael Starch\, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
DESCRIPTION:Data systems are increasingly expected to support data rates nearing network bandwidth limitations around 10Gb/s. Apache Spark is capable of high-throughputs via distributed computing and thus is a good choice to support a data system in this environment; however\, most technologies breakdown under these conditions. Thus it is essential that Apache Spark be characterized for production use at these scales. This talk will discuss the approach to running Apache Spark at throughputs on the order of 10Gb/s while performing non-trivial processing. This will give users a feel for Apache Spark&rsquo;s performance under the most demanding conditions. Setup of Apache Spark\, configuration used\, and resource requirements to process at this scale will be discussed. In addition\, concrete take-aways will be provided to users desiring to push Apache Spark to this scale.

SUMMARY:Deploying Spark Streaming with Kafka: Gotchas and Performance Analysis - Nishkam Ravi\, Cloudera
DESCRIPTION:Apache Spark is an in-memory compute engine that supports real time data processing through the streaming API. Kafka is a popular publish-subscribe messaging system used for data ingest and distribution. The performance of Spark streaming with Kafka is barely understood. In this talk\, we will discuss different Spark streaming APIs that can be used for receiving data from Kafka and evaluate their performance for complex event processing. We will also highlight some caveats and corresponding workarounds for best performance. We find that Spark+Kafka yields high throughput and sub-second latencies for complex events when configured properly.

SUMMARY:Hadoop Backup and Scaling in Hybrid Environment - Pawel Leszczynski\, Robert Mroczkowski\, Mariusz Strzelecki\, Allegro Group
DESCRIPTION:In event sourcing architecture there is a single source of truth and Hadoop is the tool to fulfil that. We use Apache Kafka and Hermes message bus as a single entry point of events. There is no efficient solution for live backup of data with CRUD operations enabled. However when handling immutable events\, we can backup data live to multiple locations like Hadoop cluster in another data center or any storage provider that supports S3 API. Storing exact copies of data in different locations allows to extend compute power of private data center with public platform provider. Such a hybrid solution benefits from cloud elasticity\, so we can easily scale on demand. In this presentation architectural design patterns for backup and compute power scaling will be presented. We also focus on technical aspects of our architecture built on the top of open source software.

SUMMARY:How to Transform Data into Money Using Big Data Technologies - Jorge Lopez-Malla\, Stratio
DESCRIPTION:We are used to hearing that we live in the Age of Data but we have to face the truth: we live in the Age of &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;. Companies are starting to realize that traditional technologies are not enough to accomplish their usual tasks with the massive amount of information that we are generating every day. Big Data processes are not as brand new as people think. Nonetheless\, what we\, the developers\, as well as the companies aren&rsquo;t used to seeing\, is getting value out of their own data. To illustrate this fact\, we are going to show a successful use case in which using Apache Spark\, HDFS and Apache Parquet\, a Middle-East Telco company could not only start a new business line getting prized information for third parties from their own data\, but also improve its own coverage network through the analysis of these data
